# TransportationsDBInterface
Incredible GUI for Transpotations MS SQL database

ABOUT

This is the university project that makes you laugh at such kind of shit you produce.
Python 3.5 was chosen as the project language. 

YOU NEED

Python 3.5, pymssql

USED MODULES/LIBRARIES

tkinter, shelve, pymssql, datetime, sys

SOME HISTORY

SHIT! The history of searching Python library or module or something that give the GUI a connection with 
Transportations database is very long (it cost the whole day). At last at 2 am the random magic and timbrel dances give the result. 
By the way at 11 pm I wanted to change 3.5 to 3.3 or 3.2 (pyodbs and pypyodbc) then to 2.7 (mxodbc). SOME MAGIC.

SOME ADVICES

1. Random magic is really good tool (although I consider it as kit).

2. Don't believe the men in youtube that speak how to connect MS SQL SERVER to Python. They are fucking assholes! 
Random search takes much less time.

3. Believe in your choise.

4. Don't stop random search even you are upset.

5.
